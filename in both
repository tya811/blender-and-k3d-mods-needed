blender and k3d need the following:
Cool retro term, cygwin could also use that. 
PCB Designer, simulator, and debugger with tutorials 
CNC 3,4,5,6 axis design and simulations with ability to 3d print cnc machines
IC, PIC designer, debugger etcetera so you can print PIC's and microchips and program them. 
Airplane, Spacecraft, Boat, Submarine, Hydrofoil, wakeboards, wakeskate, wake foils, skateboards designer. 
Ramp designer and rail designer for skateboarding and snowboarding. 

I thought it could use a chemistry simulator and chemical design and building tutorials so you can build your own biodiesel, plastic from milk
silicon, and even 3d print rocket fuel, chemical magnets, and chemcal variants of quartz clocks. 

and rubber, synthetic rubber, nylon, kevlar, carbon fiber deisgner, with physics and tutorials, and printer, so people can fine tune their rubbers
and resins. do the same with polyester, epoxy, and give a whole bunch of tutorials on all of the physics of making resin cure and un cure and
recure
so people can have the chance to build their own chemicals and have them printed in a safe manner. 
But please. documents, tutorials.

i need to model and do physics in blender and then deploy my designs in flightgear (even for spacecraft and water craft)
